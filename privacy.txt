This text describes the functionality of swiped and how your information is used.

Swiped does *not* collect any personal data that can be used to identify you. No information is shared with data brokers or any third parties.

Swiped will connect to https://swiped.pics/ periodically to sync your statistics. However, no information about the contents, location (if any) and metadata is sent.
What data is sent:
- Your overall statistics
- App Store Purchase Receipt
- Sync setting preference

How we handle your overall statistics
We keep tally of your statistics in app and on our servers, as such information is incredibly useful to analyze how, and how many people are on our service.

How we handle your App Store Purchase Receipt
App Store Purchase Receipts are cryptographically signed pieces of data by Apple which we use to authenticate upon connecting to SYNC.
These receipts do not contain information about you, your device or previous purchases. 
These receipts do contain the date of purchase, latest app version as of app purchase and proprietary verification keys by Apple.

We store your receipt as SYNC. uses those tokens to fetch, store the latest data and progress of the app.
Think of the receipts as a key to your account that you can only fetch.

What happens when you disable SYNC.?
As of writing this policy, there is no option to disable syncing.
But this is how it is planned.

When you disable sync, your device will communicate with the servers one last time to let the server know to not continue updating for other devices on the same account.

When you reset the database, your data on the server is also deleted.
